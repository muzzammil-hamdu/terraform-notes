## Detailed Notes: Terraform

### What is Terraform?

- **Terraform** is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp.
- It enables you to define, provision, and manage your infrastructure using a high-level configuration language called **HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)**.
- Terraform is **platform-agnostic**, supporting multiple service models: IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.
- It works seamlessly with various public cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP), private clouds, and on-premises environments.

### Key Features

- **Declarative Syntax**: You describe the desired end state of your infrastructure; Terraform figures out the steps to reach that state.
- **Idempotency**: Running the same configuration multiple times yields the same infrastructure state, preventing unintended changes.
- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Instead of changing existing resources directly, Terraform often replaces with new versions, increasing reliability.
- **Versioning**: Infrastructure definitions can be version-controlled with systems like Git.

### Core Concepts

| Concept          | Description                                                                                   |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Provider         | Plugin for a specific platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP, Docker).                              |
| Resource         | The infrastructure element to manage (VM, network, DB, etc.).                                |
| Module           | A container for multiple resources that are used together; promotes reuse and organization.   |
| State File (.tfstate) | Records the current state of your infrastructure; critical for Terraform's operations.   |
| Variable         | Input parameters to make configurations flexible and reusable.                                |
| Output           | Values extracted from Terraform resources to be displayed or used elsewhere.                  |

### Terraform Workflow

1. **Write**: Define infrastructure in `.tf` files using HCL.
2. **Initialize** (`terraform init`): Downloads necessary provider plugins and prepares the directory.
3. **Plan** (`terraform plan`): Shows what will change without making modifications; helps preview resource changes.
4. **Apply** (`terraform apply`): Makes the actual changes required to reach the desired state.
5. **Destroy** (`terraform destroy`): Removes all resources defined in the configuration.

### Example: Basic EC2 Instance (AWS)

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

- The above defines an AWS provider and spins up a single EC2 instance.

### State Management

- **terraform.tfstate** is a local file capturing the latest known state of all resources.
- For team environments, it's recommended to use **remote state backends** (e.g., AWS S3 with state locking using DynamoDB, Terraform Cloud) to keep state synchronized and avoid conflicts.

### Providers and Resources

- **Providers**: Integrate with external platforms (clouds, SaaS, etc.).
  - Example providers: AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, Docker.
- **Resources**: Each provider offers resource types (e.g., `aws_instance`, `azurerm_virtual_machine`).

### Modules

- Modules allow you to organize and reuse configurations, making your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and easier to maintain.

```hcl
module "network" {
  source = "./modules/network"
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}
```

### Variables & Outputs

- **Variables**: Define values to be passed at runtime.
  ```hcl
  variable "region" {
    description = "AWS region"
    default     = "us-east-1"
  }
  ```
- **Outputs**: Show key values after `apply` (like IP addresses).
  ```hcl
  output "instance_ip" {
    value = aws_instance.example.public_ip
  }
  ```

### Common Commands

| Command                  | Purpose                                                                      |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `terraform init`         | Initialize working directory with plugins and backend.                       |
| `terraform plan`         | See what Terraform intends to do.                                            |
| `terraform apply`        | Apply changes to reach the desired state.                                    |
| `terraform destroy`      | Remove all defined infrastructure.                                           |
| `terraform validate`     | Validate the code for syntax and internal consistency.                       |
| `terraform fmt`          | Format code according to style conventions.                                  |

### Best Practices

- **Use Remote State**: Share state files safely with your team.
- **Modularize Code**: Use modules for repeated patterns.
- **Keep State Secure**: Protect `.tfstate` files containing sensitive data.
- **Use Version Control**: Store your configuration files in systems like Git.
- **Plan Before Applying**: Always run `terraform plan` to prevent accidental changes.

### Supported Platforms & Ecosystem

- **Providers**: Hundreds availableâ€”clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP), SaaS (Datadog, GitHub), on-prem solutions, etc.
- **Terraform Registry**: Official marketplace for community and vendor modules and providers.

### Typical Terraform File Structure

```
/main.tf         # Main configuration file
/variables.tf    # Input variables
/outputs.tf      # Output values
/modules/        # (optional) reusable modules
/terraform.tfstate# State tracking file (often ignored in .gitignore)
```

### Installation (Linux Example)

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gnupg software-properties-common
wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | \
    gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null
